      <p>Hey! I'm an outgoing guy that loves to meet new people and 
        my life is crazy right now. 
        I play in a local twin cities band
        called Maple Sun and we play doom metal. We've been trying to
        get an album recorded but we're still waiting for the finished
        product! 
        I also own a brewery in Pine City, MN with my work
        partner Mark and we are trying to get it off the ground.
        We currently have deals with a few local businesses to supply 
        both beer and kombucha on tap and in glass.
        Me and my girlfriend are in the process of moving our stuff
        to our new apartment in Duluth, MN because she got accepted
        into her masters program at UMD in environmental studies.
        We love it here so far!
        I'm always down to meet new friends to get a drink, play Magic
        the Gathering and D&D with!
      </p>
